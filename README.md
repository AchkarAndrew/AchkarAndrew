<!--- 
And slowly you come to realize
It's all as it should be
You can only do so much
If you're game enough
You could place your trust in me

For the love of life
There's a trade off
We could loose it all
But we'll go down fighting
And what of the children?
Surely they can't be blamed for our mistakes

And slowly I've come to realize
It's all as it should be
That hiding space, a lonely place

How can the right thing be so wrong?
I've found mistakes where they don't belong

For the love of life
We'll defeat this
They may tear us down
But we'll go down fighting
Won't we?
